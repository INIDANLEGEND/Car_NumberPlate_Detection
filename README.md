This GitHub repository contains code for number plate detection using the pretrained YOLOv8 model for object detection, which has been further fine-tuned on our dataset. You can download the dataset from Kaggle using this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection. Additionally, the repository includes code for a Streamlit application to deploy our model, along with the saved model. Also Provided the requirements file which lists all the required files and dependencies.
